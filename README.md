This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the likeability and popularity of songs and artists.
 The dataset revealed a nearly even distribution of liked and unliked songs, with liked songs slightly outnumbering unliked ones. 
 Drake emerged as the most popular artist, closely followed by Disclosure, demonstrating their strong presence in the dataset. 
 Danceability appears to have a slight positive correlation with popularity, as artists with more danceable music often had more liked songs. 
 Similarly, song duration plays a role, with longer songs generally being more liked, although exceptions exist. 
 Energy and tempo also contribute to likeability, with liked songs often featuring moderately high energy (0.6–0.9) and tempos in the 120–125 BPM range. 
 These findings emphasize how various attributes influence audience preferences, offering a foundation for deeper exploration into what makes music resonate with listeners.
